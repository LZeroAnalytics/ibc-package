  IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication)
  ==================================
  This Kurtosis package instantiates an environment for Inter-Blockchain Communication between Cosmos SDK-based blockchains. It includes Hermes relayer for cross-chain communication and support for multiple connected chains.

  Prerequisites
  -------------
  - At least two running Cosmos SDK-based blockchains with IBC capabilities
  - Access to validator keys and configurations for both chains

  Configuration
  -------------
  To configure this package, you'll need to provide the following information:
  - `chains`: Configuration for participating chains
    - `chain_id`: Unique identifier for each chain
    - `rpc_url`: RPC endpoint for each chain
    - `grpc_url`: gRPC endpoint for each chain
    - `account_prefix`: Address prefix for the chain
    - `gas_price`: Gas price configuration
  - `connections`: Configuration for IBC connections
    - `src_chain`: Source chain identifier
    - `dst_chain`: Destination chain identifier
    - `channels`: Channel configuration for different port IDs
  - `relayer_config`: Hermes relayer configuration
    - `mnemonic`: Mnemonic for relayer account(s)
    - `clear_packets_interval`: Interval for clearing packets
    - `trust_threshold`: Trust threshold for light clients
